Write C# code to extract data from various all excel files from https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/oil-and-oil-products-section-3-energy-trends.

The code will need to define all the data in each sheet of each workbook as C# classes.

For each file you will need to implement a method that looks something like this:

public ExcelSheetData GetExcelSheetData(string urlOfExcelFile, string sheetName)

{

// Scrape excel file and return objects as data

}

The code must be written in C#.

Excel files should be scraped using either the ClosedXml library or NPOI library (both on nuget).
